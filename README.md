# PS4-fan-control-payloads
Collection of Payloads used to control the fan of PS4's on version 5.05, 4.74 and 4.55
All Credit goes to ethylamine, Zer0xFF, theorywrong, xvortex, kozarovv and zecoxao
The name of the payload is equal to the degrees in celsius the PS4 is going to try to maintain after running it.
65.bin = 65Â°

Multi FW works on 6.72 and probably most other hackable Versions

Most of the Payloads are not tested and might not work!
I do not take any responsibility and i am not liable for any damage done to your PS4!
